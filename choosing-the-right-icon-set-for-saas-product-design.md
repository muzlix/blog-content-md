## How to Select the Best Icons for Your SaaS Product in 2024

Icons are a small but mighty part of SaaS product design. They help users navigate, understand, and interact with your product seamlessly. But with so many icon sets out there, how do you choose the right one? Let’s dive into what you need to consider and explore some inspiring options.

## Key Considerations for Choosing an Icon Set

### 1. Icon Variety

Ever fallen in love with an icon set only to find it lacks the icons you need? It’s frustrating, especially for large projects. When choosing an icon set, ensure it offers a wide range of icons. A comprehensive set covers all your needs, from common actions like saving and deleting to specific functions unique to your product. This variety helps maintain a consistent look and feel across your entire project.

### 2. Vector Icons for Scalability

Scalability is crucial. Icons need to look good on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop. Vector icons, especially SVGs, are perfect because they can be resized without losing quality. They’re also easy to customize — change colors, shapes, or sizes to fit your design without any loss of detail. Plus, vector icons are lightweight, which means faster load times and a better user experience.

### 3. Icon Font Libraries

Icon font libraries like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) or [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) are incredibly convenient. You can treat icons just like text, applying CSS properties to change their color, size, and more. This makes them highly flexible and easy to manage. They also scale well, ensuring your icons look sharp on any device. And with thousands of icons available, these libraries usually have you covered for any design need.

### 4. Multiple Styles in Icon Sets

Flexibility is key. Icon sets that offer multiple styles — like line, filled, and colorful versions of the same icon — give you the versatility to adapt to different design contexts while keeping a consistent visual language. For example, you might use line icons for secondary actions and filled icons for primary actions. This differentiation helps users quickly understand and interact with your interface.
