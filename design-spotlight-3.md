## [Greg Olijnyk Cardboard Artist](https://www.gregolijnyk.com/)

Greg Olijnyk, based in Melbourne, Australia, has been running his graphic design studio for the past three decades. In 2017, he ventured into three-dimensional art, transitioning from keyboards to cardboard. His sculptures transform ordinary cardboard into extraordinary objects, showcasing intricate shapes and mechanisms. From cityscapes adorned with crushed beer cans to robot samurais with feathered hats, Olijnyk’s work brims with whimsical character and storytelling. Crafted without plans or digital aids, Olijnyk relies solely on a scalpel blade to bring his creations to life. Realistic joints and LED lights further enhance the charm of his pieces. Each sculpture evolves organically during creation, with every element influenced by the preceding one. This meticulous process, devoid of shortcuts, results in intricately detailed structures, be it a brick, a girder, or a delicate bird, taking weeks to months to complete.
