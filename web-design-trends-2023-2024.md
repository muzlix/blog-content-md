The world of web design is constantly evolving, with new trends emerging all the time. Here are some of the most important design trends that are likely to shape the industry in 2023 and 2024.

## **3D Interaction**<br />

3D & 3D interaction are becoming increasingly popular in web design.
This is because 3D can be used to create more immersive and interactive experiences.

One of the main reasons for the rise of 3D in web design is the increasing accessibility of 3D tools for web designers. Tools like [**Spine**](http://spline.design/) have made it possible for designers with no prior 3D experience to create realistic and engaging 3D experiences for the web.

For example, the website for the new Apple iPhone 15 uses 3D to allow users to virtually experience the phone.

Beyond immersive visuals, 3D can also create playful and engaging interactions that make websites feel more like games.

## **Giant typography**<br />
**Giant typography** is another trend that is gaining popularity in web design. This is because giant typography can be used to create a bold and attention-grabbing visual statement. Giant typography can be used to highlight important information, create a sense of scale, or simply add a touch of personality to a website.

For example, the [Anzo Studio](https://www.anzo.studio/?utm_source=extension\&utm_medium=click\&utm_campaign=muzli) website is almost entirely based on giant typography. It doesn’t take much to make this website feel special and stand out.

Another example of a website that uses giant typography to create uniqueness and character is the [**Synchrodogs website**](https://synchrodogs.com/). The use of typography in this website actually creates the grid for the website and gives it personality and a memorable element.

## **AI-Generated Designs: The Next Big Thing in Web Design?**<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*p-9LjzVBl8ayVXcNPdx54A.png)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the way we live and work, and web design is no exception. AI-generated designs are becoming increasingly popular as designers look for new and innovative ways to create engaging and visually appealing websites.

However, as of 2023, AI-generated designs are still not able to compete with human designers in terms of originality in real-world website design. The websites that AI can generate are often bland and simplistic in terms of structure.
Despite this, the field is developing at a rapid pace, and it is likely that we will see a significant leap in AI-generated design in 2024.
In addition, the use of AI can significantly reduce the time and cost of website design and development, making it a valuable tool for many web designers.

## **Scrollytelling**<br />

Scrollytelling is a type of storytelling that unfolds as users scroll down a website. Scrollytelling can be used to tell a story, explain a concept, or simply entertain users. Scrollytelling can be a great way to engage users and keep them coming back for more.

## **No-code websites**<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*hFlqGs23XdYRBaDNrueg3g.png)
No-code websites are websites that are created using a no-code tool. No-code tools allow users to create websites without having to know how to code. No-code websites are becoming increasingly popular as they make it easier for anyone to create a professional-looking website.
### **Examples of old and new tools for creating No Code websites**<br />
[**Wix Studio**](https://www.wix.com/studio)**: A No-Code Tool that is Poised for a Major Breakthrough**<br />
[Wix Studio](https://www.wix.com/studio) is a no-code website builder that has made a significant leap in capabilities and has adapted itself to professional designers. It is undoubtedly going to be a major player in 2024 alongside established and high-quality tools like [**Webflow**](https://webflow.partnerlinks.io/aar4qg1gxitv) and [**Framer**.](https://www.framer.com/?via=usemuzli)


## **AI-Driven Website Personalization**<br />
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*B6QCrNh4xLEnuctpk2ip8A.png)
The future trend I see in website design is the use of AI to create a different experience of a website for each user.

Imagine a website that dynamically adjusts its appearance, layout, or language in real-time based on the unique preferences of each visitor.

This shift goes beyond mere content recommendations; it allows users to actively influence the site’s design elements, colors, language, and even interactive features while they navigate through the platform.
This trend heralds a new era where users wield partial control over their browsing experience, creating an interactive, user-driven web interface. It’s a step towards websites that adapt and transform on-the-fly, aligning perfectly with individual tastes and preferences.

This evolution signifies a departure from static, uniform designs to fluid, user-centric interfaces, shaping the future of web design as a personalized, AI-powered experience for everyone.
